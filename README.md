Atlantic: Great Sea Battles, Heroic Discoveries, Titanic Storms, and a Vast Ocean of a Million Stories by Simon Winchester Book Review

Name: Thomas Erickson
Rating: 4.0 out of 5 stars
Title: Lots of stories of sea battles, discoveries, storms and humans that live near the Atlantic and travel it.
Date: Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on August 19, 2012
Review: I'm a fan of Simon Winchester and have read most of his books including Krakatoa and The Professor and the Madman. All good books worth reading. See my reviews.

Simon wrote a good 497 page book. The book read well with no boring parts. Some parts were more interesting than others. He does skip around time wise a lot and in different parts of the Atlantic and lands touching the Atlantic. The reader gets a good history of some of the early people who used the Atlantic, including the Vikings, the Romans, the early Irish, English, Germans, Dutch, French, Spanish, Portuguese, and many more. Also there is the unsubstantiated thought of early people crossing from the West to Europe but evidence of this is not shown.

Explorers Lief Ericson, Columbus, Cabot, and many more are shown and their contributions to Atlantic land exploration.

Some mega millions of years ago when all the continents were together and the birth of the Atlantic is shown as well as the far mega millions of year from now when the Atlantic will cease to exist as the continents will go together again is shown.

Also the vast pollution man has done to the Atlantic with oil spills and dumping of highly radioactive materials is shown as well as fishing sites , for example the Grand Banks cod industry fished out are shown. Also the near extinction of certain whales and some fish species like the Blue Fin Tuna are shown. Also the effects of global warming are shown and the rise of sea levels, glacier meltdown in Greenland and loss of ice in Antarctica are shown. Both human pumping out of greenhouse gases and the cyclical nature of the climate cycles are shown to some limited degree.

Some great sea battles with sailing ships and later steel men of war and gigantic battleships are shown. Huge hurricanes and storms are shown. Some interesting B/W pictures.

I'll give Simon Winchester credit, he wrote a wide sweep of information chapters about the Atlantic and human interaction with it. A little bit on a lot of subjects. There is some jumping around in the timeline of his writing that the reader has to get used to.
A good book with lots of interesting stories of a wide berth of information for readers with different interests. Rated 4 stars

Title: Magisterial
Date: Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on February 10, 2021
Review: The enhanced version is spectacular. I'm reminded of my favorite historians - Paul Johnson, Daniel Boorstin, Felipe Fernandez-Armesto. All see change as the result of individuals - not grand social movements. People and their actions drive the narrative - not movements or theories or simple demographics. Repeatedly we see the influence of small groups (Phoenicians) and small nations (Portugal outweigh those of well-established larger empires.

The structure (allegedly) derives from the famous "All the world's a stage" speech that included the Seven Ages of Man. He adapted this as the seven eras of the Atlantic, a semi-chronological beginning hundreds of millions of years ago with the first separation of Pangea. The Atlantic, we are told, is not eternal or permanent; it came into being and it will vanish.

In an interview Winchester states he chose the Atlantic because that is where modern civilization emerged, that is a civilization based on ideas introduced by Europe - nationhood, representation, elections, science, education, the press, individual rights, etc. (The fact that some nations violated these does not change the narrative.)

We read about unknown heroes - those first tepid explorers who sailed into the terrifying unknown for myriad reasons. We also meet many unsung heroes, men and women who made incredible contributions yet were never given their due. This is grand storytelling, almost poetic in tone. I was slightly put off by a few of the reviews but thankfully I ignored these and was amply rewarded. My grade - A

Title: A Biography of an Ocean
Date: Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on October 11, 2016
Review: "One cannot but hang one's head in shame and abject frustration. We pollute the sea, we plunder the sea, we disdain the sea, we dishonor the sea that appears like a mere expanse of hammered pewter as we fly over it in our air-polluting planes--forgetting or ignoring all the while that the sea is the source of all the life on earth, the wellspring of us all."
That environmental theme pops up quite a bit in the narrative of Simon Winchester's "Atlantic: Great Sea Battles, Heroic Discoveries, Titanic storms, and a Vast Ocean of a Million Stories."
Winchester set out to write a book explaining all there is to know about the Atlantic, which he considers to be our most important ocean. An overwhelming task and one might doubt it's even possible. He may not have succeeded in his initial goal but he comes as close as anyone in writing a biography of our ocean.
He explains how the ocean was born, how people living on its shores reacted to it and how, most importantly, it has influenced the development of the civilized world. To do this, he tells tales of man's first attempts to go out on the water, pirates, naval battles, the development of sea-going commerce and other topics. He also includes numerous anecdotes from his personal experience with the ocean.
He fears for our future if we don't change and start treating our environment like a home and not a garbage pit.
I'm not opposed to space exploration. It has resulted in many benefits for mankind. Still, I wish just a portion of the money and the interest could be directed toward oceanography. This is the planet on which we live. I have no desire to go live on a barren rock where there's no other forms of life.
